Thank you Mr. Risha for your for availing your time for me to interview this afternoon. I just want to let you know that this is one of my requirement for my assignment for my postgrad course and also we were told to interview a other multicultural. Mr. Risha just before we start can you just please just introduce yourself please.

My name is Arisha, I'm from Nosori and I'm currently working as a welfare officer at Juvenile Center. Thank you so much for that introduction Ms. Arisha. Ms. Arisha just some few questions that I have here with me.

Would you be able to answer it remember that all the information that you will provide will be confidential and it will be just for my academic purposes. Would you like to inform me, tell me anything that you don't want to share? I'll tell you as your questions come in. Okay, thank you.

Ms. Arisha, just questions like since you lived in Nosori, are you lived in a nuclear or extended family? I live in a nuclear family. So what are some of the like for instance what are some of the responsibilities that you have like you and if you have any brothers and sisters at home? Do you have any responsibilities that you are carried by your parents? Since I am working at the moment, I'm working right now, I am supposed to help with my parents with groceries and do pay for electricity bills. So that's one of my responsibilities at home.

Madam, do you have any rules in your house? Any rules or any of that sort? So being a girl and coming from an Indian family, some rules that I have is that I need to be home before 10 o'clock in the afternoon and I am not allowed to go out unless and until my parents are well informed of who I'm going with and where I'm at, what I'm doing. Thank you. What kind of things do you do or what kind of things do you want to do that your parents disagree with or what what are some of the things do your parents do that you disagree with? So you know that I am I am a working person now, I am independent, I am earning but still I have to follow their rules of how things should be.

It should be according to what they want, not what I want. Thank you so much for that. Madam, in your family, would you mind if I ask, sorry, who is the boss or who is in charge of your family at the moment? The boss, the head of my family is my father.

Are there any differences in expectation between males and females in your home? Oh no, we are all, so it's me, my brother, my cousin brother, mum and my father. So all of us at home we have our own own delegated duties. It's either if my father does the washing of the dishes, my brother will set up the beds or I will wash the car.

So there's nothing as gender divided role. Thank you, sorry, would you mind, I'm sorry for asking this, when did you or your family come to where you are at this time? I mean where you live right now? Do you move from places to places or it's just you guys are staying there? From birth or from your great-grandfathers to great-grandfathers? So before I was staying in Nandawa and then my father's work was in Nusoi, so he had transportation issues and time management wasn't that good, so we shifted to closer to their workplace. So you were not born in there? Yeah, I wasn't born there.

How long have you lived there now? I am living there for the past nine to ten years now. Can you just tell me about your traditions or celebrations or rituals in which your family participates? I know that you just mentioned that there's a lot to be going on in your house for these three days, can you just elaborate on that please? So my mom is Pat and my father is Indian, so majority of the times we celebrate the multicultural events and traditions that happen in both cultures. So we celebrate Christmas, we celebrate Diwali, we do Easter, we fast for Easter.

So for us, we want or we are supposed to follow these things so that we are able to pass it on to the younger generation of how things are done and why is it that way. So we celebrate all traditions and all celebrations, events. Thank you.

Do your beliefs match those of your family? If so, how or if not, how are they different? So do your beliefs, like your personal beliefs, is it matched with the one that you have, that your family, that you currently live in right now? Yes, for us, we have an open discussion on such things. So there are no such beliefs that are different within each other. So it's basically the same.

Yes. What holidays or other celebrations do you celebrate as a family? Like I said, majority of the traditions and the celebrations. Like for you, like for your extended family? Extended family, okay.

Extended family, we come together, either Diwali or Easter, we all celebrate it together. So yes. Thank you.

What are your favorite foods and when do you eat them? My favorite food is mostly from the seafood family. That's crab, kai and fish. So for us, normally we have it on Sundays or on special occasions or anything like that.

But it's normally on Sundays. Okay. Madam, what do you like best about where you live? Right now? Okay.

So where I live right now is like isolated from how urban city is. Yeah, and noisy, noise pollution and there is no one to like, you know, bug you at any time. We have music loud and like there's no complaints.

Okay. Thank you. What are your strong points? What are things that you like in a family? And what are the things that you don't like in a family? Yeah, freedom of speech.

And yeah, and one thing I don't like about my family is there is lack of privacy. Yeah. Since we are all like really involved in each other's life, we don't have privacy.

We don't have our own time, our own privacy like that. Yes. Thank you so much for that.

Is there anything you would change about your family traditions or practices? If you have, if there comes a time? Okay. So like I said, me being part and my parents are also part as well. Right.

So we do not have that, those like the, what can I say, the real way of doing things, you know, how it was done before. Because I feel there was a generation gap or, you know, miscommunication between the generations. So I feel that that is one of the things we would change.

Thank you so much for that. Yes. Are you part of the larger communities? Larger communities as in? Like since you live in that area, do you part of those communities or you just involve like your families? So majority, since we live in a village like settlement, we do take part in community activities.

For instance? For instance, like we, for instance, there's a temple in our area that it needs a clean up and cementing of their driveway. So we help around that. Thank you so much.

What is important for me to know about how you grew up? How I grew up? Okay. Is there a difference or is there a difference that you can see that is a difference from where, from the way you brought up and to the way that, like for instance, how like you, sorry, how individuals grew up compared to the, did you see any difference or did you notice anything that is, if it's a positive or negative way? I wouldn't say, I don't have any negative or positive way, but the thing I find different from other families is that how parents are not open with certain types of things like porn, right? And there's a menstrual cycle that, you know, that is like forbidden to be talked about when there's male figures present at the moment. So all those things, it wasn't in my family.

What are some of the important activities that you and your grandparents do together? So it's been a while that my parents have passed. The things I used to enjoy is them teaching us how to do certain things. Like there are certain foods that my parents don't know how to cook that they knew.

So I used to try and grasp the little activities and the things they used to do. So yeah, just mainly based on cooking because yeah, they were smart. In terms of, like for instance, I'm sorry, in terms of discrimination experiences, have you ever been treated poorly because of your beliefs or ethics?

Sorry, as you like in terms of discrimination, have you ever been treated poorly because of your beliefs, affinity or ways? I just wanted to share an experience I faced when I was working in Parliament. In Parliament, I was normally surrounded with Ethiopian culture. I understand it's the Fijian government, but like we were less Indophigians, right, present in the Parliament.

So one thing I faced was, they were with the conversation they used to have. So some of the things that they said, I could not understand because I did not, like I do not know that kind of level of Fijian, you know. What we know is the broken Fijian and you know how it is in Fiji, right.

And also one other thing is they used to recruit majority of the Itokay people with, even though, you know, it's like, it's more like whom you know type. Yeah, so I was, yeah, that's the only thing I faced. Okay, thank you so much for that.

Have you ever felt different, like since you're saying that you are working at the Parliament in Musa Itokay? So have you ever felt different from others because of your beliefs or your race? For me, I try not to feel like, you know, not to feel that I'm different. I try to adapt, I try to blend in with my surroundings so that it keeps me going. And in that way, I feel, you know, much more stronger.

So, yes. Thank you. What are some of the wrong assumptions that, like, people have made about you? About me? You, as an individually, compared to the Itokay, what are some of the, like, in your perspective, what are some of the wrong assumptions that you might want in, like, maybe because of these? Can you just, like, in details? So, one thing that people might assume about me is that I'm stubborn.

I don't talk too much because I really, rarely socialize with people. I don't talk to a person or share things with a person until and unless I know I'm comfortable with. So, yes, maybe they think that I am grumpy or stubborn or I'm not an easy girl to talk to.

So, Madam, in terms of, like, I know that you, you know, religious, you are, like, mixed Muslim, can you just, what kind of spiritual or religious beliefs are important to you and your family? Like I said, coming from a mixed background, I feel each and every religion is much more important. Most of all, the biggest religion I feel is human being. And I feel that is something that we all need to understand, to stop differentiating between the religious, like, for instance, Fijian, Indo-Fijian and all.

It's just you being a human, that's the biggest religion of all. Thank you. Do you have any favorite holidays or traditions or celebrations? If you do, like, which one are the most important to you in a family and why? For me, there are two important, what can I say, holidays.

One would be Easter. We all know the importance of Easter. That is when Jesus sacrificed himself for our scene.

That is one of the important holidays for me. And the other one is the one. That is when our Lord Rama came from the exile after 14 years and then he, you know, he ruled and he came back to the king.

So, yeah, those two are the most important for me. Do you go to church? Yes, I do go to church. And tell me about going to church.

So, I normally attend the church beside the Totono police station. Or the same entry. Yes, that one.

I am not well versed of the way, you know, it is supposed to be. You know, how things are supposed to be done in the church. But what knowledge I have gained through seeing my parents, seeing my family.

Yeah, so you enter, as you enter, you bow down, kneel down, pray, light the candle. Do you pray? Yes. How do your beliefs affect your daily life? There are some certain things that I feel that is wrong when it comes to daily lives.

I know that you are working at the juvenile center, right? Like you must be experiencing some, you know, some stress, trauma, and anxiety. Because you are dealing with the hang offenders. And since these are only one institution that looks after the hang offenders in Fiji, which is the place that you can be working in.

In terms of your mental health and mental health treatment, how would people in your family, I mean, for you personally, how would you explain what you are going through right now and why do you sometimes seek counseling or you go home and seek advice from your parents? So there are certain cases, as you know, that I'm working in juvenile. There are certain cases that are confidential, right? Not certain cases, majority. Majority is confidential.

So what I do is I do journal. Every night is a must, I do journal. I write down my thoughts or whatever I have raised during the day.

So in that way, I put out the thoughts on a paper and it acts as a counselor to me, you know? It doesn't talk back, but it listens to me, you know? So in that way, I am relieved. I have less anxiety, less depressed. And one other thing I do is, so we have this AI now, right? Check GPT or whatever you guys call, we call.

So I actually, you know, talk to it, you know, to... They can respond to you. Yeah, they can respond to me on how... You can deal with some issues. Deal with issues, yes.

Madam, does your culture have a perspective on mental health therapy or counseling? Okay, so we all know that talking to somebody else or seeking counseling has a stigma of being, of being psychiatric, what can I say, mad, right? They consider mental illness for us as we are growing up and we are studying all these things. We are well educated, so I don't feel like there's an issue with my culture, having those issues with sticking help to the counseling. What does mental health therapy or counseling mean to you? Mental health counseling or counseling in general would be... For me, it would be like talking about issues that, you know, that I know that I'm not comfortable with sharing to any other person that knows me, because they might use it against me, right? And so I feel talking to somebody else makes it easier, so that, you know, we understand their perspective on it.

And all we need nowadays is an ear, you know, an ear to listen to us, whether it's complaining or whether it's appreciating or anything. So all we need is an ear to listen to, to be heard, actually. Thank you for that.

What are things in your culture, does that help with your sadness? What are some of the things your culture does that helps with your sadness, anxiety, bad experience and other troubles? I know that counseling, you know, just recently we have, again, for instance, in Fiji, before we hardly, we have counselors, and now that we have counselors in schools, also psychiatrists, that we seek advice and seek professional counselors. So before we only have that counseling, like, for instance, for Fiji, we only seek advice from our elders, like inner beliefs, what in your culture, what are the things that your culture does to help with the stress, anxiety? With my culture, like the thing, like I said, it was stigmatized to talk about your issues to somebody else, right? So in my culture, like right now, in this era, we live in, we are open to share. But before we were just, you know, we are modeled up, we do not share, because when we share, our culture feels that we are low, low confidence, low self-esteem.

So, yeah. What were the things you did in your country that helped with the sad feelings and distress? What ideas do you have for what would work in this country? In this country? All right. What would better work? Okay.

I would prefer people to know about the various ways in which we can, you know, deal with these issues. There are many ways. If you don't want to talk to a counselor, you can write it down.

Like, what we do is journaling. We can do journaling. We can even talk to a person, you know, who we know we could trust.

We know that that person wouldn't judge us on whatever we have and wouldn't use that against us. So first of all, I would recommend is that we create awareness of what actually counseling is. Because counseling, for majority of the people, is just illness, sick, mental health issues.

It's a perspective. That's my perspective. Okay.

Who is the main person you go to if you want help or want to talk about something important? Who is the number one person that you go to? For me, it's my father. So we have a relationship from the starting that we don't, you know, I don't hide anything and whatever issues. Whether it's about the girl life, my girl life or, you know, life in general.

So he is the best person to go for advice and counseling. Thank you. Who keeps you feeling strongly and supported? My parents.

Okay. Are there ways your culture has for handling trauma or are there really bad life experiences? Are there any other ways that your culture can deal with it? Can I have that question again, please? Are there ways your culture has for handling trauma or are there really bad life experiences? Is there a way that our culture, like for, like for Fiji, if we don't care, it takes a village to raise a child. So everyone has to help and do their part, the village, the handyman, the mother, the father, grandfather, auntie, uncle.

In some ways, in order for a child to be brought up, we will need each other's help. I feel it's same for the culture I belong to. For the Indian culture, we also practice the same thing.

So, yeah, we have priests especially. We have, you know, those members that are available of such, what can I say, such members that have such abilities, you know? And powers, skills to help a person in need. So, yeah.

Madam, I have asked you a lot of questions. Do you have any questions for me about assessment or counseling? Is there something you want to tell me that we haven't talked about? No, that's it. I'm sorry.

What are some of the things I may have missed, the questions I've asked? Do you go by any other name that what is listed? Would you mind? Because I called your name. Is that okay with you? Yeah, it's okay with me. It's fine.

Is there anything else about your background or cultural identity that you think is important for me to know, to help you? No. No, I don't think so, yeah. Okay, thank you so much, Ms. Arisa, for your time.

Thank you, Ms. Arisa. I hope that whatever we discuss today, it will be confidential. It's just for my assignment purposes only.

I will not use it for something else. But I would like to take this time to thank you for available, for availing yourself in your time, for me to conduct an interview with you. I hope that you will be able to have a blessed weekend, a long weekend, and may God bless you and my family.

Naka, all the very best for your assignment. Naka, thank you.

Culture can be understood through multiple interrelated dimensions that explain how human societies develop complex behaviors and traditions. The first dimension emphasizes innovation and conceptual processing, highlighting humans’ unique ability to integrate perceptions and memories to generate novel ideas. Unlike instincts or simple associative learning, conceptual learning allows humans to experiment, hypothesize, and create solutions to novel challenges, such as the fermentation of dairy to mitigate lactose intolerance. The second dimension involves selection and diffusion, where cultural traits are tested against environmental pressures and social networks. Ideas that prove advantageous, whether in survival, nutrition, or technology, are transmitted, modified, and refined as they spread, illustrating a Darwinian like selection process applied to culture rather than genes.
The third dimension focuses on environmental uncertainty and adaptability, showing that societies exposed to fluctuating resources, climates, or social conditions favor cognitive flexibility and extended learning periods. Extended juvenile phases and longer lifespans provide humans with the temporal space to acquire knowledge, experiment with behavioral innovations, and transmit solutions across generations. The fourth dimension highlights the social and networked nature of culture, where knowledge is accumulated, shared, and adapted within communities. From historical innovation hubs like the Dutch Republic to modern centers such as Silicon Valley, dense social networks facilitate iterative experimentation and conceptual refinement, demonstrating how human intelligence, collaborative learning, and environmental pressures jointly drive the evolution and resilience of cultural practices.
Moreover Research on bilingualism highlights a strong connection between language and emotional experience, showing that individuals generally experience more intense emotions in their first language compared to a second language. Empirical studies indicate that emotional words, phrases, and even taboo expressions evoke stronger psychophysiological responses, such as increased skin conductance, when processed in the native language (Caldwell-Harris, 2014; Dewaele, 2004, 2008; Harris et al., 2003). This effect is explained by the contexts in which languages are acquired: the first language is typically learned in emotionally rich environments, linking words more closely with feelings, whereas second languages are often acquired in neutral classroom settings, creating a larger emotional distance. This emotional distance can influence various aspects of cognition and social interaction, including therapy, trauma processing, romantic relationships, and decision-making, where the use of a second language can reduce emotional intensity and even promote more rational or less biased choices (Keysar et al., 2012; Dylman & Bjärtå, 2019). Overall, these findings suggest that the emotional resonance of language is shaped by both cultural and experiential contexts, illustrating how language serves as a critical mediator between culture and emotional life.

EMOTIONS-
The readings “Cross-Cultural Variation in Emotion Regulation: A Systematic Review” by Nosheen Ramzan and colleagues, and “Negative Emotions in Romanian and Spanish Romantic Relationships: A Cross-Cultural Approach” by Andreea Ursu et al., both explore how emotions are shaped and expressed differently across cultures. They explain that while emotions are universal, the way people manage, show, or hide them depends on their cultural values and social expectations. For example, in some cultures, people are encouraged to control their emotions to maintain group harmony, while in others, open emotional expression is seen as healthy and honest.
Ramzan’s review highlights that emotion regulation the ways people try to influence their emotional experiences is strongly influenced by cultural beliefs. Individualistic cultures (like the U.S. or Western Europe) often value expressing emotions freely as a form of self-expression, whereas collectivist cultures (like many Asian societies) emphasize emotional control to protect relationships and social balance. These differences show that emotion regulation is not just a personal skill but a social and cultural practice.
Similarly, Ursu and colleagues’ study on Romanian and Spanish romantic relationships shows how culture shapes emotional experiences in love and conflict. Although both groups experience similar negative emotions such as anger, jealousy, or sadness, they deal with them differently. Romanians may regulate emotions to maintain respect and avoid conflict, while Spaniards may express them more openly to achieve closeness and understanding. Overall, both studies remind us that emotions are deeply connected to cultural norms, relationship values, and the ways people learn to communicate their feelings.
ATTRACTION-
Attraction, from a cultural perspective, means that what people find appealing or desirable in others is strongly influenced by their culture’s values, traditions, and social expectations. While physical beauty and kindness are often seen as attractive everywhere, different cultures have their own ideas about what makes someone a good partner. For example, in individualistic cultures, people may be attracted to traits like independence, confidence, and personal achievement. In contrast, in collectivist cultures, attraction often centers on family background, respect, loyalty, and the ability to maintain harmony within relationships.
Culture also shapes how attraction is expressed. In some societies, open flirting or showing affection is common and accepted, while in others, attraction is shown more subtly through actions, respect, or family involvement. Even the process of choosing a partner can reflect cultural beliefs—some cultures value romantic love as the main reason for marriage, while others see attraction as something that grows after marriage and shared responsibilities.
Overall, culture plays a major role in guiding how people think about love, beauty, and relationships, influencing both who they are drawn to and how they express that attraction

The Relationship Between Language, Culture, and Thought
Introduction

Language, culture, and thought are deeply connected and influence how people understand themselves and the world around them. Through language, individuals express ideas, share emotions, and maintain cultural traditions. Researchers such as Imai, Kanero, and Masuda (2016) as well as Dylman, Champoux-Larsson, and Zakrisson (2020) have shown that language shapes the way people think, communicate, and even experience health and emotion. This paper discusses the role of language and health within this relationship, showing how both are affected by culture and communication.

Language

Language is more than a system of words — it is a cultural tool that shapes thought and social interaction. According to Imai, Kanero, and Masuda (2016), language influences how people categorize and understand their experiences. The words available in a language guide how individuals notice, remember, and describe things in their environment. Through language, people learn cultural ways of thinking, which forms part of their worldview and personal identity.

Different languages emphasize different aspects of human life. For example, some languages contain rich vocabularies for describing relationships, respect, or the natural environment. This reflects what each culture values most. When people use their language to talk about family, land, or spirituality, they are not only communicating but also preserving their cultural heritage. Thus, language becomes a living record of a people’s history, customs, and moral values.

Language also maintains social connection and unity. It allows communities to share stories, beliefs, and emotions that strengthen relationships. When a language begins to disappear, part of the culture and traditional knowledge also fades. Therefore, protecting local and Indigenous languages is essential for maintaining cultural identity, wisdom, and collective memory. In this sense, language connects the past, present, and future of a community.

Health

Language plays a crucial role in how people understand and express health and illness. Cultural beliefs influence the words people use to describe pain or emotional distress. In some cultures, illness may be explained in spiritual or moral terms rather than medical ones. If health workers do not understand these linguistic and cultural meanings, it can create misunderstandings and affect treatment. Clear communication in health care therefore depends on respecting both language and cultural background.

Language also affects how individuals describe symptoms and seek help. When patients struggle to express themselves in a second language, they may leave out important details about their condition. This can result in misdiagnosis or confusion about medication. Health professionals must therefore use culturally appropriate communication and, when necessary, interpreters to ensure understanding. Respectful listening and language sensitivity help build trust and improve patient outcomes.

Furthermore, language influences how societies view mental and emotional health. Some cultures lack words for certain mental health conditions, making it harder to discuss or treat them. Others use emotional language freely, promoting openness and support. These differences show that health is not only biological but also shaped by social and linguistic factors. Recognizing this connection helps professionals deliver care that respects people’s values and experiences.

Conclusion

In summary, language connects deeply with both cultural understanding and human well-being. It shapes how people think, communicate, and interpret their surroundings. In the context of health, language determines how illness is described, understood, and treated. When language and culture are respected in communication, especially in health care, people feel more valued and understood. Understanding the relationship between language, culture, and thought reminds us that communication is not just about words — it is about sharing meaning, identity, and care.
